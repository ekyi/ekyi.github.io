### Project: BlueFruit 


[DevPost Documentation](https://devpost.com/software/bluefruit) 

This project was inspired by civic art projects. It was eventually launched as gallery+ TXT with 10 items at the Yale Art Gallery in Spring 2016. gallery+ TXT was prototyped as "BlueFruit" at Unhackathon 2015 with John Tambunting, Cameron Yick, Victor Zhen, and Mohammad Islam. Twilio Devangelist Rob Spectre helped us with the Twilio boilerplate and mentorship! 

We wanted to explore how communicating directly with art could affect people's experiences in the museum. gallery+ TXT was an app built using the Python Flask Framework, Google Spreadsheets, and the Twilio API. I learnt how to work with JSON-encoded data for the first time through involvement in this project.
